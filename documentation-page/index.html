				</header>
				<p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
					simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
					together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
					development in many areas on most platforms.
				</p>
				<p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for
					all major platforms from</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the Python web site</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.python.org/"> Python.org</a></li>
					<li>may be freely distributed</li>
					<li>Paid</li>
					<li>Free from many websites</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs
					and tools, and additional documentation.</p>

					Invoking the Interpreter
				</header>
				<p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.11 on those machines where it is
					available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the
					command:</p>
				<code>python3.11</code>
				<p>to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option,
					other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python
					is a popular alternative location.)</p>
				<p>On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.11 command will be
					available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting
					environment variables for other ways to launch Python.
				</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="Interactive_Mode">
				<header id="comparation">
					Interactive Mode
				</header>
				<p>When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts
					for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines
					it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message
					stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:

				</p>
				<code>
					python3.11
					Python 3.11 (default, April 4 2021, 09:25:04)
					[GCC 10.2.0] on linux
					Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
					>>>					
				</code>
				<p>Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if
					statement:</p>
				<code>
						the_world_is_flat = True

						if the_world_is_flat:
						
								print("Be careful not to fall off!")
						
						
						Be careful not to fall off!
						
					</code>

			<section class="main-section" id="Source_Code_Encoding">
				<header id="Source_Code_Encoding">
					Source Code Encoding
				</header>
				<p>By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most
					languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the
					standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should
					follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it
					must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.</p>
				<p>To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line
					of the file. The syntax is as follows:</p>
				<code># -*- coding: encoding -*-
					</code>

				<p>
					where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.

					For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file
					should be:
				</p>

				<code>
					# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
				</code>

				<p>One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case,
					the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:</p>
				<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
					# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-</code>
