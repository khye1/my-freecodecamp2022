				<h2>Here's a time line of Mr. Nguyen Du's life</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1975: Born in Bich Cau, Thang Long, Hanoi</li>
					<li>1775: Nguyễn lost his father, he also lost his mother at age 13, so for most of his teen years he lived
						with his brother Nguyễn Khản or with his brother-in-law Đoàn Nguyễn Tuấn. </li>
					<li>1784: At the age of 19 (some sources say 17), Nguyễn passed the provincial examination and received the
						title of "tú tài" (Bachelor's degree), which made him (very roughly) the equivalent of a high school
						graduate.</li>
					<li>1813: While in China, he discovered and translated the Ming dynasty era tale that would become the basis
						for the Tale of Kieu</li>
					<li>1820: Published the Tale of Kieu</li>
					<li>He was later appointed to two more diplomatic missions to Peking, but before he could depart for the last
						one, he died of a long illness for which he refused treatment. </li>
				</ul>

				<p><i>The Tale of Kiều (Vietnamese Truyện Kiều) was based on an earlier Chinese prose narrative, Kim Vân Kiều.
						It was written under a pen-name as the story was quite critical of the basic tenets of Confucian morality.
						It is a tragic tale of two lovers forced apart by the girl's loyalty to her family honor. In Vietnam, the
						poem is so popular and beloved that some people know the whole epic by heart and can recite it without a
						mistake</i>
